# RP4Car
After a certain robotics club was no longer particpating in a certain robotics competition, they set their eyes on recreating Rocket Leauge with RC cars made in house. Unfortuntely, the car was never finished, and what is left is code to control a motor with a xinput controller.

Abstract:
This github page hosts the code of a rc vehicle that is semi-operational. You could probably reuse the code to control motor devices with xinput devices for a wide variety of purposes. 

Parts used in this project:
- pi-top [4] (You can switch this out for any sort of raspberry pi)
- l298n motor driver
- Battery capable of outputing 12v for the L298n and pi?
- 1 wood board
- some bolts and nuts
- GPIO wires
- 3D Printers

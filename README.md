# RP4Car
Abstract:
This is a python script that uses a raspberry pi 4 in conjuction with two L298N modules and a servo to accept signals from an X-Input device (like an xbox controller) designed for use in an wirelessly controlled vehicle. 

The remote control vehicle is designed after a RWD car, and will need a mechanical differential
